Sourcing Data from publicly available New York's Department of Buildings datasets I have tried to train a supervised machine learning 
model which predict the amount of fees required to obtain a particular permit.

As I stated the data is freely available at https://opendata.cityofnewyork.us/. You will also need to install standard Machine Learning 
libraries like numpy, pandas and Sci-Kit Learn.

Feel free to experiment and suggest improvements
